  ## OVERVIEW:
   A mobile-first lifestyle and e-commerce website. This was built to promote the Bota lifestyle and promote the sustainable and ethically sourced Bota products. Currently the single product is a subscription service to body butter, that comes in handmade, reusable ceramic ramikens. The site is engineered to be updatable and maintainable by the owner, with a functioning admin page to update state, products and presence for the user experience. The site is aimed at using technology and design in service of promoting healthy and sustainable lifestyle and products.

  ## Installation
  The admin page is accessed through a secret password entered in the text field of the contact page. For development and grading purposes, entering the phrase 'Margarine is gross' will bring you to the admin login, and any email and password will allow you to access the admin page. In the future, the passphrase would be changed and the access and JWT would only be given to approved users. 

  ## Usage
  Currently the admin page can create, read, update and delete products only. Future versions should include blog functionality, admin controls, as well as image and content updates for the user/consumer experience.

  ## Tests
  No tests were harmed in the making of this animal.
