            <h6>THE PRODUCT</h6>
            <p>The sincere interest in intelligent, purposeful, circular and sustainable design guides our objectives.</p>
            <p>The product is a subscription-based multifunctional waterless skincare formula that initially comes in a sculptural stoneware vessel and is thereafter refillable. The refills come in a compostable packaging. The stoneware vessel is a multi use art object that can be: a cup, an oil or incense burner, trinket container - the possibilities are endless. It is designed to be used again and again, then passed down as an heirloom.</p>
            <p>This product is made with deliberate attention to mindful sourcing, low CO2 emissions, H2O preservation, non-toxicity & pollution, as well as responsible afterlife.</p>

            <h6>OUR VALUES</h6>
            <p>Bota's objective is to pioneer providing the finest skincare products through a cradle-to-cradle approach, fostering a symbiotic relationship between people and the earth.</p>

            <h6>PACKAGE</h6>
            <p>Bota vessels are architecture & landscape. All elements of bota are 'of the land'. Contents, vessel, and packaging.</p>
            <p>We demonstrate this in a deconstructed way where raw versions of the ingredients, vessel, and packaging are displayed.</p>
